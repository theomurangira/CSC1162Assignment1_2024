Question 1
=============
You have a business of many bicycles that
 people can rent. We assume that:
 Somebody  rents a bicycle no more than 
 24 hours within the same day.
The rate per hour depends on the time 
of the day as follows:
 0 - 7         and 21-24  the rate 
is RWF 500 per hour
 7-  10     and      19-21 the rate
 is  RWF 1000 per hour
10- 19 the rate is 1500 per hour 
Write a python program that takes as 
input the starting time and the ending time 
and  does the following:
(a) If the starting is greater than the
 ending time or the sarting time or ending
  time is out of the range 0-24, 
  then display invalid input
(b) Print the total amount to be paid 
by the renter.
Question 2
============
We have six types of mushrooms : 
Agaric jaunissant
Cepe de bordeaux
Amanite tue-mouche
Coprin chevelu
Girolle
Pied Bleu
•The cepe bordeaux is the only 
one to have pores, the other mushrooms
 having gills.
 •Both coprin chevelu and agaric jaunissant 
 grow In meadows, other mushrooms grow 
 in forests
 •The only mushrooms to have a convex cup 
 are agaric jaunissant,amanite tue-mouches,
  and pied bleu.
  •The only mushrooms to have a ring are 
  agaric jaunissant,amanite tue-mouches,
  and coprin chevelu.
  The User thinks of a mushroom (one of the six).
The program asks at most three of the  
following four questions.
The User answers truthfully by yes or no
Based on the user’s answers, the program 
determines the mushroom.
The questions: 
Does your mushroom have gills ?
Does your mushroom grow in a forest ?
Does your mushroom have a ring?
Does your mushroom have a convex cup?
